This repository contains the code related to the following paper:
> Breton, Charles, Pierre Blanchet, Ben Amor, and Francesco Pomponi. « A novel method to calculate SSP-consistent remaining carbon budgets for the building sector: A case study of Canada ». Building and Environment 269: 112474. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2024.112474.

## Description
The script in this repository can calculate country-specific carbon budgets using open-source datasets, for different scenarios and allocation methods.

Notably, the script relies on data from the following paper: 
> Gütschow, Johannes, M. Louise Jeffery, Annika Günther, and Malte Meinshausen. « Country-Resolved Combined Emission and Socio-Economic Pathways Based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and Shared Socio-Economic Pathway (SSP) Scenarios ». Earth System Science Data 13, nᵒ 3: 1005‑40. https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-1005-2021.

The PMSSPBIE files (Version 1.0) are available [here on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3638137).
